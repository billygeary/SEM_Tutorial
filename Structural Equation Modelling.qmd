## Ecosystems are complex

-   Ecosystems are complex, with multiple interacting components
-   If we want to understand them well (and hopefully attribute causation), we need methods that are able to test these relationships when randomised experiments aren't possible.

## What is a Structural Equation Model?

-   Statistical technique that allows us to test complex relationships between multiple variables at once
-   Networks of variables where some are both predictors *and* response variables
-   Tests whether a proposed model structure represents patterns in the data well (ideally giving causal inference)

## What sort of questions can SEMs answer?

-   *"I think fire affects bandicoots, but i'm not sure whether it's just about how foxes and cats respond to fire, or fire in its own right"*
-   We can write this out as a Directed Acyclic Graph (fancy conceptual model)

## What sort of questions can SEMs answer?

```{r}
example_dag = dagify(
  bandicoot ~ fox + cat + fire,
  fox ~ fire,
  cat ~ fox + fire
) 

example_dag %>% ggdag() + theme_void()
```

## Key Concepts

-   *Causal Thinking* - SEMs require us to specify a model structure based on ecological theory. Means thinking about mechanisms
-   *Direct vs. Indirect Effects* - How one variable influences another can occur through multiple pathways
-   *Latent vs. Observed Variable* - Latent variables are unmeasured and represented through multiple indicators. Observed variables are what we directly measure
-   Focus on how ecosystems work *mechanistically* rather than which variables are correlated with each other

## SEMs vs Other Methods

-   *Regression*: One response variable at a time
-  *Path Analysis*: SEMs are an extension that allow for latent variables & complex error structures
-   *Bayesian Networks*: Probabilistic dependencies and uncertainties in causal directions. SEMs assume fixed causal structures

## Model Structure

-   Measurement Model (Latent Variables): How are unobserved variables measured through indicators/proxies
-   Structural Model (Causal Paths): The causal pathways between latent and observed variables

## SEM Workflow

1.  Develop your conceptual model
2.  Translate into a path diagram
3.  Specify the statistical model (often a series of linear equations)
4.  Fit the model (e.g., `lavaan`, `piecewiseSEM`, or `brms`)
5.  Evaluate model fit
6.  Interpret path coefficients
7.  Scenario Analysis

## An example - What drives post-fire plant diversity?

-   Borrowed from Jarret Byrnes: https://rpubs.com/jebyrnes/brms_bayes_sem

## The conceptual model

-   Grace and Keeley wanted to know what influences plant species richness

## The conceptual model

-   We'll focus on how plant species richness (`rich`) is affected by fire severity (`firesev`) and plant abundance (`cover`)

```{r}
keeley_dag = dagify(
  rich ~ firesev + cover,
  cover ~ firesev
) 

keeley_dag %>% ggdag() + theme_void()

```

## Converting to an SEM

```{r}
#| echo: true
data("keeley")

k_fit_psem <- psem(
  lm(rich ~ firesev + cover, data=keeley),
  lm(cover ~ firesev, data=keeley),
  data = keeley
)
```

## Model Coefficients

-   Visualise the SEM coefficients using `coefs(k_fit_psem)`

```{r}
coefs(k_fit_psem)
```

## Visualise the SEM

-   Plot the SEM using `plot(k_fit_psem)`

## An example - Fire, rainfall and predation in south-west WA

## An example - Fire, rainfall and predation in south-west WA

![](upperwarren_sem_result.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## An example - Fire, rainfall and predation in south-west WA

- *Scenario analysis* or *query based approaches* to test how modifying one variable in the model flows through to affect something else, considering both *indirect* and *direct* effects. 
- Allows for uncertainty propagation

## Traps and Tips

-   Causal assumptions: correlation ≠ causation  
-   Start simple and build up
-   Sample size (ideally >10 observations per parameter)
-   Watch out for nonlinearity & non-normality (`piecewiseSEM` and `brms`)
-   Look out for when you need to standardize coefficients
-   Use a range of model fit indices (Chi-square, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR)
-   Acknowledge alternative model structures (AIC, WAIC, R squared)

## R Packages

-   `lavaan` - The OG SEM R package. Has a Bayesian cousin called `blavaan`
-   `piecewiseSEM` - The most commonly used SEM package in ecology, very flexible model formats and good help material
-   `daggity` - For creating reproducible Directed Acyclic Graphs (conceptual models) in R
-   `brms` - My personal favourite for doing SEMs (super flexible model forms, distributions, uncertainty representation)
